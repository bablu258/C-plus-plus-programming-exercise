Structures - Introductory Examples
 

 

These examples build on program 7-1 in the textbook.

Example #1 renames the Payroll structure to Employee (more logical name). It also has separate input and output functions rather than having all that code in main. A single Employee instance is created in main. 

Example #2 builds on Example #1 by creating (and passing) an array of Employee instances rather than a single Employee instance. It also includes an alternate main function which uses dynamic memory allocation (rather than the stack as in the first main function) to create the array of Employee instances.

Example #3 builds on Example #2 by adding an enum and a union.  

 

Example #4 builds on Example #1 by adding to the Employee structure a member variable of another structure,  Date.

 

Example #5 similarly builds on Example #2 by adding to the Employee structure a member variable of another structure, Date.

Example #1

 #include <iostream> 

#include <iomanip> 

using namespace std;

 struct Employee {
     int empNumber; 
     char name[80]; 
     float hours;
     float payRate; 

};

 void input(Employee*); 

void output(Employee);

 int main()
 {
     Employee emp;
     input(&emp);
     output(emp);
     return 0;
 }

 void input(Employee* e)
 {
     cout << "Enter the employee's number: ";
     cin >> e->empNumber;
     cout << "Enter the employee's name: ";
     cin.ignore();
     cin.getline(e->name, 80);
     cout << "How many hours did the employee work? ";
     cin >> e->hours;
     cout << "What is the employee's hourly payRate? ";
     cin >> e->payRate;
 }

 void output(Employee e)
 {
     cout << "\nHere is the employee's payroll data: \n";
     cout << "Name: " << e.name << endl;
     cout << "Number: " << e.empNumber << endl;
     cout << "Hours worked: " << e.hours << endl;
     cout << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2);
     cout << "Hourly pay rate: $" << e.payRate << endl;
     cout << "Gross pay: $" << e.hours * e.payRate << endl;
 }

Sample run

 

Enter the employee's number: 111
 Enter the employee's name: Genghis Khent
 How many hours did the employee work? 3.4
 What is the employee's hourly payRate? 1.25

 Here is the employee's payroll data:
 Name: Genghis Khent
 Number: 111
 Hours worked: 3.4
 Hourly pay rate: $1.25
 Gross pay: $4.25
