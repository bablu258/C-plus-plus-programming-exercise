Arrays (Character) - Programming challenge (Password Validation)
 
This program prompts the user to enter a proposed password SSN. The user's input is stored in a C-string (not a string). You may assume that the user's input does not include an embedded space.
The program then tests whether the password is valid. The password is valid if it meets the following rules:

Length between 6 and 8 characters
Consists only of letters and digits (e.g., no punctuation characters)
Has at least 1 upper case letter, 1 lower case letter, and 1 digit
The test of whether a password is valid is performed by calling from main a function named isValidPassword that you will write. The isValidPassword function takes as an argument the proposed password inputted by the user, and returns true if the proposed password meets the above rules, false if it is not.

If the password is in a valid format, then the program first outputs this information before ending. Sample input and output:

Password: MischaP1
MischaP1 is valid
If the password is not in a valid format, then the program first outputs this information before ending. Sample input and output:

Password: MischaP666
MischaP666 is invalid
Here's the code given to you. The comments indicate the code you need to complete.  

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// include any other library files you need
// prototype isValidPassword

int main ()
{
char pword[80];
bool result;
cout << "Password: ";
cin >> pword;
/* call isValidPassword */
if (result == true)
   cout << pword << " is valid\n";
else
   cout << pword << " is not valid\n";
return 0;
}

// implement isValidPassword
