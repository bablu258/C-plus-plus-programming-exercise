Dynamic Memory Allocation of C-strings
 
This handout shows an example of dynamic memory allocation of a C-string. 
 
//dyncstring.cpp
 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
// allocate memory large enough for any potential input; could be different than 80 elements
// this buffer for input (which I call buffer) is not created by dynamic memory allocation
char buffer[80];
cout << "Enter input: ";
cin >> buffer;
// need character pointer for dynamic memory allocation
// following two statements (declaration and assignment) could have been combined into one (initialization)
char *p;
// need strlen + 1 for NULL character after user input; size declarator not 80
p = new char [strlen(buffer) + 1];
// insert here any code to work with dynamically allocated c-string, whose "name" is p
// when done free dynamically allocated memory
delete [] p;
return 0;
